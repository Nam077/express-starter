# Express Starter Kit README

## Introduction

This README provides a comprehensive guide to the Express Starter Kit, designed to jumpstart development with Express.js. It leverages cutting-edge tools and practices to deliver a robust foundation for building web applications.

## Features

-   **Express.js Backend**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
-   **Handlebars Templating**: Minimalistic templating engine, making it easy to create semantic templates.
-   **TypeORM Integration**: Adds support for data manipulation using Object-Relational Mapping.
-   **Awilix Dependency Injection**: Simplifies the management of dependencies for inversion of control.
-   **Modern Tooling Setup**: Includes configurations for Babel (for using ES6+ syntax), ESLint (for code quality), Prettier (for formatting), and Webpack (for bundling).

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js (latest version recommended)
-   npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Nam077/express-starter.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
    ```
    cd express-starter
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. **Run the Application**
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Structure Overview

-   `/src`: The heart of the application, containing all server-side logic, organized into various folders for better maintainability.
    -   `/controllers`: Responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
    -   `/services`: Contains business logic, service layers interact directly with models to perform data operations.
    -   `/models`: Represents data models, typically corresponding to database tables in ORM.
    -   `/routes`: Defines server routes, associating them with controller functions.
    -   `/views`: Holds Handlebars template files, which are rendered and sent by controllers.
    -   `/config`: Configuration files and environment variables for different aspects of the application, such as database connections.
    -   `/public`: Static files accessible to the public, such as images, CSS files, and client-side JavaScript.
    -   `/validation`: Defines validation rules for incoming requests.
    -   `/utils`: Utility functions used throughout the application.
-   `/tests`: Tests for the application, including unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
-   `.env`: A file for environment variables (not tracked in Git for security reasons) used to store sensitive information like database passwords.
-   `package.json`: Defines npm dependencies along with project or package information.

## Development

-   **Running in Development Mode**: Use `npm run dev` to start the application with nodemon, allowing for hot reloading.
-   **Environment Configuration**: Store sensitive information and configuration in `.env` files (not included in the repository for security reasons).
